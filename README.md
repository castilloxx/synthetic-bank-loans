##  Project Workflow

###  Phase 1: Data Cleaning (MySQL)
- Checking for duplicates
- Checking and removing of nulls and inconsistent entries
- Standardizing data
- Adding age grouping, income grouping and credit ratings column

###  Phase 2: Data Exploration (MySQL)
- Loan approval rate
- Approval rate by gender
- Approval rate by income group
- Approval rate by credit rating

- Loan approval vs late payments
- Top 10 ranking customers by credit scores
- Average loan amount by age group
- Customers with above average credit score in their age group
- Employment status impact on approval

### Phase 3: Visualization (Tableau Public)
#### Key Charts:
-  KPI Cards (Total Applicants, Average creditscore, Average loan amount.)
-  Loan Approvals by Gender

## Results/ Key insights and findings
- Majority of loan applications are approved.
- Approval rates are relatively balanced between genders.
- Higher income groups (100k+) show greater approval rates and applicants with income <50k have notably lower approval likelihood.
- Applicants rated "Excellent" or "Good" have significantly higher approval rates while those rated "Poor" are rarely approved, even if income is high.
- Top loan purposes include; Personal, Home and Education.

  ## Recomendations
- Consider tightening approval thresholds for applicants with poor credit + high late payments.
- Use CreditRating and LatePayments as top variables in spoting risky applicants.
- Explore flexible rates for high-income applicants with lower credit scores.
